## Project Overview

The Quadrature Down Converter (QDC) is a crucial block in communication systems used to down-convert RF signals to baseband by mixing the input with local oscillator signals shifted by 90°. This project includes the LTSpice simulation model, analysis plots, and documentation detailing the design process, simulations, and results.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Explore the `ltspice-model` folder to view and simulate the QDC circuit.
2. Refer to `docs` for detailed project explanations and results.
3. Review `plots` and `waveforms` for visual understanding of the circuit behavior.
4. Use the LaTeX source in `docs/latex-source/` if you want to build or edit the final report.

If you want, I can help generate a nice **LinkedIn post draft** based on this too! Just say the word.
